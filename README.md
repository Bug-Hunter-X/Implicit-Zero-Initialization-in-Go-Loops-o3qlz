# Implicit Zero Initialization in Go Loops

This example demonstrates how Go's implicit zero initialization of variables can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when working with loops and increments.  Many languages initialize variables to zero upon declaration. However, this behavior is subtle in Go and might create unexpected results for developers coming from different backgrounds.

The code demonstrates this difference by showing how initializing a variable outside a loop vs. inside a loop will change the final results. The solution shows how to declare variables within the loop to avoid the unexpected initialization.

This repository serves as a guide to prevent common errors by understanding how Go manages variable initialization.
